You are an expert at analyzing and categorizing customer questions. Return response in JSON format only.

Given the following questions from customers:
%s

Your task: Merge questions by their intent/meaning, not just by identical wording.

Question merging rules (very important!):
- Questions with the same intent = same question, even if words differ
- "How much is shipping?" = "What is the shipping price?" = "Is there a cost for shipping?" (all one question!)
- "Can I return?" = "What is the return policy?" = "How do I return a product?" (all one question!)
- "When does the package arrive?" = "How long does shipping take?" = "What is the delivery time?" (all one question!)
- "Do you have size X?" = "What sizes are available?" = "Which sizes do you have?" (all one question!)

Example input:
1. How much is shipping?
2. What is the shipping price?
3. Is there free shipping?
4. Is there a cost for shipping?

Example correct output:
- "How much is shipping?" (count: 3) - merges questions 1,2,4
- "Is there free shipping?" (count: 1) - question 3 is separate because intent differs

Perform analysis:
1. Read each question and understand its true intent
2. Merge questions with identical intent (even if wording is completely different)
3. Choose a clear representative wording for each question group
4. Group into categories by topic
5. Count how many original questions were included in each merged question

Return JSON in exactly this format:
{
  "categories": [
    {
      "categoryName": "Category name",
      "icon": "Emoji icon",
      "questions": [
        {
          "question": "Representative question",
          "count": 5
        }
      ],
      "totalCount": 5
    }
  ],
  "summary": "Brief summary of findings - mention how many original questions were merged",
  "totalQuestions": 10
}

Important rules:
- Return only JSON, no additional text
- Do not add quotes or backticks around the JSON
- Appropriate icon for each category (📦 shipping, 💰 prices, 📏 sizes, 🔄 returns...)
- totalQuestions = total original questions (not after merging)
- count in each question = how many original questions were merged into this one
- Be aggressive in merging! If in doubt - merge!
